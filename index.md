I, like Ritsuko am not fond of talking about myself, so [here](https://ringindex.tumblr.com/) is a link to my tumblr account.

## Programming
```rust 
fn main() {
    // Print text to the console
    println!("Hello CSE 110!");
}
```
My favorite programming language at the moment is rust, however C is responsible for originally sparking my interest in programming!

HTML & CSS are cool too because I find the process of building the visual experience of a webpage via descriptions of the page rather than the more intuitive process of creating something via a gui to be a beautifully interesting challenge.

## Art

I make weird, conceptual bits of art that span most mediums from photography to music to programming

I don't make my portfolio publicly available because I don't care to.

## My Favorite Media

### Some Neat Movies I Reccommend:
- Seven Samurai
- Noroi
- Everything Everywhere All at Once
- Glengary Glenn Ross

### My favorite Video Games:
- Stephen's Sausage Roll
- Dark Souls
- Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess
